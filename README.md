## Requirements
- [Node js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (only for bower)
- [Bower](http://bower.io/#getting-started)
- A webserver to run the app on (just static files)
- A server running the REST API [backend](https://github.com/dotKom/onlineweb4/tree/develop/apps/shop) (not needed for dummy testing)

## Setup
- start `bash` or `cmd` and `cd` to nibble
- run: `bower install`
- fill in `host`, `apiRoot`, `client_id` and `client_secret` in "config.json"
- open the location of `index.html` in a webserver (opening as `file://` messes with angular)
